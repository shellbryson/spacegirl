# SpaceGirl

## What is it?

An single-page CSS animation playpen (but SpaceGirl is no plaything!).

## How this works

This is a Fabric Pattern Library based project, so the main assets (CSS, JavaScript)
are held in a separate Pattern Library repo.

Head over to: https://github.com/shellbryson/spacegirl-patternlibrary to view the
original assets.

Fabric itself will be open-sourced later this year.

## Why?

Experimentation in CSS animation, showcasing techniques and providing code to share on
Shell Bryson's technical blog at https://sheru.uk/.
